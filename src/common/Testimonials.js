                  <p>I was charged with battery/bodily injury with Deadly Weapon. He successfully co-defended me with his partner and the case against me was thrown out in court! He was able clear my record in matter of a couple of months. I now have a clean record and a new job! I would recommend him to anybody in legal trouble or need!</p>

                  <p>I was charged with one count of battery with bodily injury, a DUI, and 3 other traffic tickets. If convicted, I faced months of jail times plus thousands of fines and other fees. I decided to hire Mr. Sereenen and he did not disappoint me. In fact, after a bench trial, all my charges were dismissed! I had a great result with this attorney. The affordable legal fee was a huge plus!</p>
